#this file contains the same parameters used in teh creatiopn of deliverables.  
#the fdefault filename is config.txt, but you can have as many of these as you like, and call them on the command line
#e.g you can have 1 per mission and call them mission1.txt, mission2.txt etc
#and then run the program like this...
#python c:/infinitytool/ggtool/deliverablesynch.py -config mission2.txt -i <inputfolder> -o <outputfolder>
#etc
#It just makes it easier to configure the process
#entries can be in any order, just ensure the key work (e.g. basin) is at the very start of the line, followed by a comma then the value.
#no spaces please!
#always use a forward slash '/' not a back slash '\'
